Smooth and Flexible Movement Control of a Robot Arm@OsakaU

Parameters of the arm can be adjusted by modifying assignment.c.  
In each folder exists an execute.sh file, use this to compile the arm. It creates .dat files and .png files.  
You can use .plt files with gnuplot and eps.sh (skip if not exist) to plot .dat files into .eps files.  
make_video.sh can help make .png files into .mp4 and .gif files of the animation of the arm simulation.
